Is Pangram assignment

Determine if a sentence is a pangram. A pangram (Greek: παν γράμμα, pan gramma,
"every letter") is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once.
The best known English pangram is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
The alphabet used is ASCII, and case insensitive, from 'a' to 'z'
inclusively.

##I found several examples of the pangram solution and since I didn't write them
##myself I added multiple examples that I used to understand how a solution could
##be found in python.
